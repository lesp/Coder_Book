This is the home for all of the project files used in my Google Coder for Raspberry Pi ebook.
The ZIP archive should be imported in to your Google Coder install, from where you will be able to examine the source code and hack to your hearts content.

You are free to modify and alter the code, no permission is required from myself, hack and enjoy!

Enjoy!
